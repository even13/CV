I am a Software Engineer in training at Makers Academy. After spending 3 years as a specialist in 3D imaging for natural sciences, I am now looking to challenge myself in a new environment and secure a permanent position in a tech team. 

I have been drawn to a role within this field as my skills allow me to easily work with a variety of software and programmes due to my logical, analytical and problem-solving nature. 

I am an observer, listening to the information provided to me, taking on board the key details and coming up with evidence-based solutions and ideas. This means that I deliver results in line with specifications. 

I have a natural eye for detail and accuracy which has been developed through my previous career as a specialist in 3D data for academic research.


#### What is Makers Academy?
Makers is a highly-selective software development bootcamp in 16 weeks. More info about Makers [here](https://makers.tech/).


## Skills

#### Logical thinking

As part of my work as a research assistant, I determined which tool to use to produce the best possible 3D image depending on the specimen. I also established best practice protocols for surface scanning and for the processing of 3D scan data.

#### Attention to detail

I enjoy detail-oriented work and perform well in tasks that require accuracy. In my previous role, I selected specimens for scanning according to precise criteria thanks to an in-depth knowledge of the anatomy of the skull. The selection had to be done quickly due to limited time, which means working under pressure and to tight deadlines while maintaining accuracy, as a poor choice would impact the sample and the research being conducted. 

I also processed 3D scans to prepare them for further study with high-degree precision. This required following a number of specific steps for each scan. Many palaeontological specimens are by nature incomplete or deformed, so I needed to reconstruct the missing elements to a high level of detail so that the specimen could be used in our sample.

All this required me to be focused and to check things multiple times to minimise mistakes, which would have affected the quality of the sample and the results of the statistical tests being conducted.


#### Organisation

I successfully organised several international data collection trips across the US, Canada and Europe. This required me to travel with large, high-precision scanning equipment that I used to produce 3D scans of zoological and palaeontological specimens from over twenty collections in museums and universities.

I collaboratively planned the agenda of the trips and sent it to collection managers, making sure that staff and material would be available when I arrived. I planned the logistics of the trip, booking flights and hotels and ensuring that the equipment was safely transported so that no damage occurred. I drove around the different countries, putting route plan in place so that I attended the different locations on time. These trips were conducted by myself, I did not have a team with me. 

#### Communication

I trained colleagues and students to become proficient, independent users of 3D scanning hardware and software. I would adapt my style of communication depending on levels of knowledge about using a 3D scanner or 3D visualization software, mostly for Masters and PhD students, postdocs and research staff, but also sometimes for the public, including young children. I used a mixture of group-based learning, with demonstrations for the whole group, and one-to-one training, with a more hands-on approach.

When colleagues and students were off-site for scanning I also supported them, either being available to communicate directly with them by email on specific questions, or coming along for more challenging material. This way, I made sure that all questions and queries they might have would be answered in full, and that potential difficulties were overcome.

## Hobbies and Interests

I enjoy choir singing, classical singing and reading fantasy novels. 
I am passionate about the natural world and I love natural history museums (museums in general, too).
I speak French and English.
In my previous role I travelled around the world to gather and produce 3D scans of vertebrate skulls. I'm sure there's an example of that [somewhere](https://www.goswamilab.com/single-post/2018/09/05/A-Megaptera-Mission-Recipe-for-scanning-a-humpback-whale-skull) on the internet.
