I am a Software Engineer trained at Makers Academy. After spending 3 years as a palaeontologist specialised in 3D imaging, I am now looking to challenge myself in a new environment and secure a permanent position in a tech team.   


## Strengths

#### Curiosity and love of learning
My master’s degree and following career in academic research allowed my natural curiosity to thrive and turned it into a research skill, which enables me to pull meaningful information from technical documentation and successfully use it in context. I have efficiently used my ability to learn while studying software engineering at Makers, but also before, as I taught myself 3D imaging for the natural sciences to a level that allowed me to pursue a career in the field.  

I am passionate about learning and naturally drawn to a role that will allow me to further my craftsmanship as a developer. 

#### Problem-solving

I am a natural problem-solver, which allows me to break down bigger problems into smaller ones and build a solution accordingly, be it related to code or to something completely different. As part of my previous work as a research assistant, I determined which tools to use to produce the best possible 3D model depending on the specimen. I established best practice protocols for surface scanning and processing 3D scan data which led to successful data collection and scientific publications.     

During engineering projects, alongside delivering Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) under the guidance of a simulated product owner over 2-day sprints, I focused on using agile methodologies in a team context to solve complex problems and deliver adaptable, effective services that met the specifications.   


#### Attention to detail

I enjoy detail-oriented work and perform well in tasks that require accuracy. In my previous role, I selected specimens for scanning according to precise criteria and in a limited amount of time. This meant working under pressure and to tight deadlines while maintaining accuracy, as a poor choice would impact the sample and the research being conducted. I also processed 3D scans to prepare them for further study with high-degree precision, and sometimes performed a virtual reconstruction of missing elements to a high level of detail so that the specimen could be used in our sample.

All this required me to be focused and to check things multiple times to minimise mistakes, which would have affected the quality of the sample and the results of the statistical tests being conducted. I also use this skill while debugging code, in order to make sense of the error message, tighten the loop and find an appropriate solution.

#### Organisation

In my job before Makers, I collaboratively planned the agenda of several international data collection trips across the US, Canada and Europe, for which I visited over twenty collections in museums and universities. I coordinated with collection managers, academic researchers and other stakeholders, making sure that staff and material would be available when I arrived. I planned the logistics of the trips and drove around six different countries with the scientific equipment I needed, putting route plans in place so that I could attend the different locations on time.

I have a high level of self-organisation and I take responsibility for the parts of a project that depend on me, in terms of quality and rapid delivery. This is something I found useful when we had our first experience of Agile methodologies in our group projects at Makers, particularly while working in 2-day sprints.

#### Communication and team work

My solid basis of software knowledge is complemented by essential communication skills I have developed in my previous career as a research assistant. In 2019 I took part in the European Researchers Night at the Natural History Museum in London, where I had the opportunity to demonstrate surface scanning to all kinds of people, from young children to museum enthusiasts to university professors. The ability to communicate efficiently on technical topics has also been very important when working in teams at Makers, as it permits to ask the right questions about the problem at hand.

When colleagues and students were off-site for scanning I also supported them, either being available to communicate directly with them or coming along to help for more challenging material (for example, see my none-too-serious tutorial on [how to scan a whale skull](https://www.goswamilab.com/single-post/2018/09/05/A-Megaptera-Mission-Recipe-for-scanning-a-humpback-whale-skull)). This way, I made sure that all questions and queries they might have would be answered in full, and that potential difficulties were overcome.

## Hobbies and Interests

I practice choir and classical singing.     
I am curious by nature and enjoy getting an in-depth knowledge of things I'm interested in. I am passionate about the natural world and science, and I love natural history museums (museums in general, too). I also enjoy looking for fossils or archaeological objects.  
I am a native speaker of French and bilingual in English. Each language works with its own logic, its own idioms, and learning to express my thoughts in a different language has helped me develop a more open mind and generally modified the way I think or approach things.
