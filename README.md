I am a Junior Software Engineer in training at Makers Academy, now keen to secure a permanent position in a tech team where I can develop and expand my skillset.


#### What is Makers Academy?
Makers is a highly-selective software development bootcamp in 16 weeks. More info about Makers [here](https://makers.tech/).


## Skills

I think some of the skills I developed in my first career transfer rather well to a role in software engineering. I trained and worked as a palaeontologist and specialized early in 3D imaging.

#### Logical thinking

As part of my work as a research assistant, I determined which tool to use to produce the best possible 3D image depending on the specimen. I also established best practice protocols for surface scanning and for the processing of 3D scan data.

#### Attention to detail

I enjoy detail-oriented work and perform well in tasks that require accurate focus on details. In my previous role, I identified specimens for scanning according to certain criteria of completeness, thanks to an in-depth knowledge of the anatomy of the skull in tetrapods. I also processed 3D scans to prepare them for further study with high-degree precision.

#### Organisation

I succesfully organised and carried out several international data collection trips (travelling with large, high-precison scanning equipment in six different countries and producing 3D scans of specimens from over twenty colllections in museums and universities).

#### Communication

I trained colleagues and students to become proficient, independant users of 3D scanning hardware and software.

## Hobbies and Interests

I enjoy choir singing and reading fantasy novels. I am passionate about the natural world.

## Extra stuff

- I speak French and English.
- 
- In my previous role I travelled around the world to gather and produce 3D scans of vertebrate skulls. Yes I did. It's on the internet [somewhere](https://www.goswamilab.com/single-post/2018/09/05/A-Megaptera-Mission-Recipe-for-scanning-a-humpback-whale-skull), but it's probably not worth reading this. It's my one and only blog post, though.
