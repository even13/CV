I am a Software Engineer trained at Makers Academy. After spending 3 years as a specialist in 3D imaging for natural sciences, I am now looking to challenge myself in a new environment and secure a permanent position in a tech team. 

I have been drawn to a role within this field as my skills allow me to easily work with a variety of software and programmes due to my logical, analytical and problem-solving nature. 

I am an observer, listening to the information provided to me, taking on board the key details and coming up with evidence-based solutions and ideas. This means that I deliver results in line with specifications. 

I have a natural eye for detail and accuracy which has been developed through my previous career as a palaeontologist.   


## Skills

#### Logical thinking

As part of my work as a research assistant, I determined which tool to use to produce the best possible 3D image depending on the specimen. I also established best practice protocols for surface scanning and for the processing of 3D scan data.  

This allows me to break down bigger problems into smaller ones and build a solution accordingly, be it related to code or to something completely different.

#### Attention to detail

I enjoy detail-oriented work and perform well in tasks that require accuracy. In my previous role, I selected specimens for scanning according to precise criteria and in a limited amount of time. This meant working under pressure and to tight deadlines while maintaining accuracy, as a poor choice would impact the sample and the research being conducted. 

I also processed 3D scans to prepare them for further study with high-degree precision. Many palaeontological specimens are by nature incomplete or deformed, so I sometimes needed to reconstruct the missing elements to a high level of detail so that the specimen could be used in our sample.

All this required me to be focused and to check things multiple times to minimise mistakes, which would have affected the quality of the sample and the results of the statistical tests being conducted. I also use this skill while debugging code, paying attention to what the error is in order to make sense of it and find an appropriate solution.


#### Organisation

I successfully organised several international data collection trips across the US, Canada and Europe, for which I visited over twenty collections in museums and universities.

I collaboratively planned the agenda of the trips and sent it to collection managers, making sure that staff and material would be available when I arrived. I planned the logistics of the trips and drove around the different countries with the scientific equipment I needed, putting route plan in place so that I attended the different locations on time. These trips were conducted by myself, I did not have a team with me. 

I have a high level of self-organisation and I take responsibility for the parts of a project that depend on me, in terms of quality and rapid delivery. This is something I found useful when we had our first experience of Agile methodologies in our group projects at Makers.

#### Communication

I trained colleagues and students to become proficient, independent users of 3D scanning hardware and software. I would adapt my style of communication depending on levels of knowledge about using a 3D scanner or 3D visualization software. I used a mixture of group-based learning, with demonstrations for the whole group, and one-to-one training, with a more hands-on approach.

When colleagues and students were off-site for scanning I also supported them, either being available to communicate directly with them by email on specific questions, or coming along to help for more challenging material (for example, see my none-too-serious tutorial on [how to scan a whale skull](https://www.goswamilab.com/single-post/2018/09/05/A-Megaptera-Mission-Recipe-for-scanning-a-humpback-whale-skull)). This way, I made sure that all questions and queries they might have would be answered in full, and that potential difficulties were overcome.

The ability to communicate efficiently on technical topics has also been very important when working in teams at Makers.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Nov 2019 - Feb 2020)
A selective coding bootcamp where TDD, pair programming and agile methodologies are combined to produce well-rounded developers with a growth mindset.

- Object Oriented Programming
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Domain Driven Design (DDD)
- Agile methodologies
- XP values
- Ruby, RSpec, Rails
- JavaScript, Jasmine, Node.js, React, Jest
- PostgreSQL databases
- Build tooling (CI/CD, Travis)

#### University of Montpellier (Sep 2013 - Jun 2015)

_**MSc in Biodiversity, Ecology and Evolution, specializing in Palaeontology** (2-year program)_   
In this course I learned how to tackle academic research projects, for example how to manage my time on a project and meet deadlines, how to extract information from technical or scientific documentation, and how to break down big problematics into smaller problems. I also gained my first experience of coding through my internships, which involved statistical analysis with R. I graduated with a grade equivalent to a UK 2:1.   

#### University of Poitiers (Sep 2010 - Aug 2013)
_**BSc in Earth and Environment Sciences**_    
I developed my scientific curiosity and my logical thinking throughout the course, which approached current-day problematics in geology. It gave me a solid background in my field that allowed me to grow as a scientist. I graduated with a UK 1st equivalent.

#### Lycee Camille Guerin, Poitiers (Sep 2007 - Jun 2010)

_**Baccalaureat, Science stream with Natural Sciences, option advanced English**_   
I gained a broad cultural background and passed final exams in all sorts of subjects: Maths, Physics, Biology, Geology, English, French, German, History, Geography, Latin. I obtained Mention Bien (High Honors) on the general grade of the Baccalaureat.

## Experience

**Natural History Museum and University College London** (May 2016 - Aug 2019)

## Hobbies and Interests

I practice choir and classical singing.     
I am curious by nature and enjoy getting an in-depth knowledge of things I'm interested in. I am passionate about the natural world and science, and I love natural history museums (museums in general, too). I also enjoy looking for fossils or archaeological objects.  
I am a native speaker of French and bilingual in English. Each language works with its own logic, its own idioms, and learning to express my thoughts in a different language has helped me develop a more open mind and generally modified the way I think or approach things.
